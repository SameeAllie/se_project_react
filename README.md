Overview

This is the first React project created as a Practicum Student.

There are a couple of modals available with relatively simple functionality.

The first modal is to preview the picture of the garment recommended for the current weather.

The second modal is for adding a new garment to the list that is already available. Easily open the modal and add the necessary garment to the list of available choices.

We are also calling a weather API that bases our weather location off of longitude and latitude coordinates.
